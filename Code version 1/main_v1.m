% DESCRIPTION
% Goal: solve and simulate a finite period consumption and saving problem
% (a.k.a. cake eating problem). Setting: there is no income or
% uncertainty. The consumer starts with an endowment of assets and chooses
% how to allocate consumption over time in order to maximize his utility.
% We solve this by backward induction using a search algorithm to locate
% the choice that maximizes the value function in each period.

%% IMPORTANT
% Make sure all variables and memory are clean from information stored in
% past runs in order to avoid conflict or potential bugs.

tic; % this starts counting the running time of the code (facultative)
clear all; % clears memory
close all; % closes any graphs

%% DECLARE VARIABLES and MATRICES that will be 'GLOBAL' 
% declare the variables and matrices that are needed from or for other files

global beta gamma r r % our model parameters (note: you can write them spaced like this)
global num_pts_assetgrid Agrid % assets grid and dimension
global interpMethod % numerical interpolation method used
global tol minCons % numerical constants
global plotNumber % for plotting the result

%% Numerical methods
% Select solution, interpolation and integration methods. 
% Interpolation method: 'linear', 'nearest', 'spline', 'pchip'
% Note 1: spline and pchip use piecewise cubic polynomials (pchip is shape
% preserving)
% Note 2: linear is the default option. 

interpMethod = 'linear';

%% Numerical constants
% Here we set the constants needed for the numerical solution and
% simulation

tol = 1e-10;    % max allowed error
minCons = 1e-5; % max allowed consumption√†

%% The economic environment
% Here we set the values of structural economic parameters and initial
% values for simulations

T = 80;         % number of time periods (years)
r = 0.01;       % interest rate
beta = 1/(1+r); % discount factor
gamma = 1.5;    % coefficient of relative risk aversion
startA = 1;     % initial asset endowment

%% Grids
% Here we choose the dimension and select methods to construct grids

% grid for assets
num_pts_assetgrid = 20; % number of points in the discretized asset grid
grid_method = 'equalsteps'; % method to construct the grid: equalsteps, logsteps, 3logsteps, 5logsteps or 10logsteps

%% Get asset grid
% Here we fill the assets' grid for each period using 'grid_method'

[ MinAss, MaxAss ] = get_min_and_max_ass(startA);

asset_grid = NaN(T+1, num_pts_assetgrid);
for ixt = 1:1:T+1
    asset_grid(ixt,:) = getGrid(MinAss(ixt), MaxAss(ixt), num_pts_assetgrid, grid_method);
