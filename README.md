This repo is intended to work as a support for learning to use MatLab to solve dynamic programming problems.

### Topics
1. Introduction to programming in MatLab
2. Simplest consumption-savings problem: cake eating problem (problem, simple example, existence and uniqueness of solution)
3. Introduction to dynamic programming (Bellman equation, recursive solution, optimality conditions, numerical solution, practical implementation)
4. Life cycle income process (credit markets, numerical solution, practical implementation)
5. Stochastic optimization (Markov processes, iid income process, autocorrelated income process, numerical solution, practical implementation)
6. Infinite horizon (problem, existence and uniqueness of solution, example, numerical solution, practical implementation)
